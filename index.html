                            Beyond basic calculations, it supports advanced features like graphing functions,
                            making it an essential tool for solving equations, visualizing data, and exploring mathematical concepts with ease.

                            It efficiently detects and highlights movement in video feeds,
                            making it a valuable tool for surveillance, activity monitoring,

                                Working with you as a tutor was extremely helpful. Your ability to explain complex concepts clearly and accessibly significantly helped me improve my knowledge, even though I was learning everything in French. Also, your patience was wonderful. Thank you again for everything!

                                Kerim was of great help in understanding the basics of programming. He was very patient and an excellent professional as an instructor. He selflessly shared his knowledge to help me understand instead of memorizing. Every praise for Kerim as an instructor—keep up the great work.

                                I attend the Druga gimnazija, IB program. Kerim gave me lessons in mathematics. He explained complex concepts in a very effective way, which I easily understood. He went through all the tasks I didn't understand and made learning easier. For Kerim as a tutor, I have nothing but praise!

                                My experience with Kerim as a tutor is very positive. He is eager to explain and has no problem repeating things multiple times for others to understand. He is very patient and always available. It's very efficient to learn with him, even for students who start studying later.
